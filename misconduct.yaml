  allegation: falsifying campaign finance reports
  text: In 2024, Rep. Ogles was accused of falsifying campaign finance reports when his amended finance reports were compared to the originals. He claimed he had loaned his campaign $320,000 in 2022 and had not. It's unclear whether the the money came from elsewhere or was entirely made up. He also amended finance reports to remove both contributions and expenditures. There is no indication of a House Ethics Committee investigation even though this would also be a violation of House rules in addition to a possible crime. In the first week of August, 2024, a Department of Justice search was conducted and his cell phone seized.

  name: Meadows
  text: In 2016 Meadows was investigated for retaining an employee through 2015 who
    did not perform duties after 2014 commensurate with the compensation the employee
    received. This employee, Mr. West, had been demoted after Meadows learned of West's
    sexual harassment of other Meadows' staff. Meadows commissioned his own investigation
    and ignored the recommendation to fire West. Further, Meadows did not seek guidance
    on whether continuing to pay West was in accordance with House Rules and his separatist
    approach to keeping West on staff, but away from women staff was effectively discriminatory
    since it precluded their access to to Meadows. For these reasons, the Committee
    [unanimously voted to reprove Meadows and to require him to repay West's excess
    two month's salary of $40,625.02](https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/Meadows%20Report%20FINAL%20with%20sigs.pdf).
