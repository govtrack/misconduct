  allegation: engaging in wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds, making
    materially false statements to the House of Representatives, credit card fraud,
    identity fraud and conspiracy with respect to his 2020 and 2022 campaigns; failing
    to properly disclose required information on statements filed with the House;
    violating federal conflict of interest laws in connection with his role in a firm
    providing fiduciary services; and/or engaging in sexual misconduct towards an
    individual seeking employment in his congressional office.
  text: On Dec. 1, 2023, Santos became [the sixth member of Congress to be expelled
    in a 311-114 vote](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2023/h691). In May
    2023, Santos was indicted on charges of identity theft, fraud, money laundering,
    lying to the House of Representatives on financial disclosure forms, and theft
    of public funds. The charges include a scheme to fraudently induce political contributors
    to donate more money than was legal and then use those contributions for personal
    purposes. Santos was also accused of taking unemployment funds while employed
    in 2020. In early fall 2023, a campaign aide  pleaded guilty to wire fraud and
    identity theft in a scheme to raise funds for Santos while his campaign treasurer
    pleaded guilty to related charges. In November 2023, the House Committee on Ethics
    [found substantial evidence](https://ethics.house.gov/committee-reports/matter-allegations-relating-representative-george-santos-0)
    that Rep. Santos violated federal criminal laws and other standards of conduct
    including lying to campaign donors, creating fictitious campaign loans obscuring
    payments to himself, using campaign funds for personal expenses, and falsifying
    financial disclosures. The Ethics Committee did not find evidence of alleged sexual
    misconduct. It deferred everything else to the Department of Justice. The investigation
    began in early 2023 after extensive reporting that Santos [fabricated most of
    his life story](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/list-of-george-santos-lies-all-the-mistruths-the-congressman-is-accused-of-telling/4043980/)

  allegation: engaging in a sexual relationship with underage girl, using illicit
    drugs, sharing inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misusing state
    identification records, converting campaign funds to personal use, and accepting
    a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift
  text: In March 2021, The New York Times reported that the Department of Justice
    was investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz for allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship
    with an underage girl. Over the ensuing weeks the allegations expanded, and the
    House Committee on Ethics [opened an investigation](https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-chairman-and-ranking-member-committee-ethics-regarding-representative-22)
    into it as well as allegations of using illicit drugs and accepting an impermissible
    gift, as well as other allegations that were dropped in 2024 (see timeline). In
    2023, [the Department of Justice announced it would not charge Gaetz](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-justice-department.html).
    However in June 2024 the Ethics Committee [announced that it is still investigating
    those allegations (sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, improper gifts) as well
    as special favors and obstructing government investigations](https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-regarding-matter-representative-matt-gaetz).
    Two weeks after the 2024 election, on Nov. 13, [President-elect Trump announced
    that he would be nominating Gaetz for Attorney General](https://www.wbal.com/matt-gaetz-ag-nomination-timeline/).
    [Gaetz resigned](https://www.wbal.com/matt-gaetz-ag-nomination-timeline/) from
    Congress that day. On Nov. 21, [CNN published still more details about allegations
    that Gaetz paid for sex with a minor](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/matt-gaetz-second-sexual-encounter-minor/index.html).
    Later that day, he withdrew from consideration for Attorney General. On Dec. 23,
    2024, the Ethics Committee [released the report of their investigation into Gaetz](https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-of-the-committee-on-ethics-regarding-representative-matt-gaetz-2/)
    in which they concluded there was substantial reason to believe that he had used
    illegal drugs, paid for sex and, under FL law, committed statutory rape.
